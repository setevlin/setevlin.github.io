## <u>About Me</u>

Hi, I'm Sierra! I am a soon to be graduate from the University of California, Davis. I will be graduating with a B.S. in Applied Statistics, with an emphasis in Economics, and a minor in Psychology. Hopefully, next year I will be in a Master of Finance program. My data science interests include sports (specifically baseball because my heart belongs to the Angels), psychology, and the economy.
